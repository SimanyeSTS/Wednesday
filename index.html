    <h1>There are different programming languages that involve web development</h1>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h3>Markup Languages</h3>
    <p>
        HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the backbone of web development, providing the structure and content of web pages. It consists of a series of elements, each enclosed in tags, which define the purpose and formatting of different parts of a webpage. HTML is primarily used for creating the basic structure of websites, including text, images, links, and other media elements. <br>

XML (Extensible Markup Language) is a versatile markup language designed to store and transport data, particularly suited for exchanging information between different systems over the internet. Unlike HTML, which focuses on presentation, XML emphasizes the organization and categorization of data. It allows users to define their own custom tags, making it highly adaptable to various data structures and applications. <br>

SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) is a markup language for describing two-dimensional vector graphics in XML format. It enables the creation of high-quality graphics that can be scaled to any size without losing clarity or resolution. SVG is widely used for creating interactive graphics on the web, such as logos, icons, illustrations, and charts. Its ability to be manipulated with CSS and JavaScript makes it a powerful tool for creating dynamic and responsive visual content on websites.

<h3>Style Sheet Languages</h3>
<p>
    Style Sheet Languages play a crucial role in web development by defining the presentation and layout of web pages. The most commonly used style sheet language is CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), which allows developers to control the appearance of HTML elements, including colors, fonts, spacing, and positioning. CSS simplifies the process of creating visually appealing and consistent designs across multiple web pages and devices. Additionally, preprocessors like Sass (Syntactically Awesome Stylesheets) and Less (Leaner Style Sheets) extend the functionality of CSS by introducing features like variables, mixins, and nested rules, enhancing code maintainability and efficiency. These style sheet languages empower developers to create modern and responsive web designs that adapt to different screen sizes and user preferences, improving the overall user experience.
</p>
<br>
<br>
<h3>Scripting Languages</h3>
<p>
   Scripting languages are essential tools in web development for creating dynamic and interactive functionalities on websites. One of the most prominent scripting languages is JavaScript, which runs directly in the browser and allows developers to manipulate webpage content, handle user interactions, and communicate with web servers asynchronously. JavaScript is versatile and widely supported, making it ideal for creating rich web applications, animations, and interactive features. Additionally, server-side scripting languages like PHP (Hypertext Preprocessor) and Python with frameworks like Django or Flask enable developers to build robust backend systems for handling data processing, user authentication, and server-side logic. These scripting languages empower developers to create dynamic and responsive web experiences, bridging the gap between static content and interactive functionality, thereby enhancing user engagement and satisfaction
